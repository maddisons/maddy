title: I Love Swimming Lessons
---
Today I started swimming lessons and I loved it. I can do freestyle so good now. Pa would be proud of me because he is an [ironman](http://katieball.me/archie/). I told my mum I want to join a swimming club and go to the public piled ask the time. She said yes 😁.

I will wrote more about it soon.
